# 7-Day Array Mastery Plan

Absolutely! Here’s a focused 7-day array mastery plan aimed at building solid fundamentals in essential patterns—so you’ll confidently handle slippery optimizations, nested loops, and core techniques.

---

## 🗓️ Weekly Schedule (6–7 problems/day)

### 🎯 Core Patterns to Master:

1. Two Pointers  
2. Sliding Window  
3. Prefix Sum  
4. Kadane’s Algorithm  
5. Simple Binary Search  
6. Hash Map  

Each day combines problems targeting one or two patterns, progressively increasing difficulty.

---

### Day 1: Two Pointers & Basic Sliding Window

1. Two Sum (sorted input variant)  
2. Valid Palindrome (ignoring non‑letters)  
3. Reverse String (in‑place)  
4. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array  
5. Two Sum II – Input Array Is Sorted  
6. Valid Palindrome II (allow one deletion)  
7. Sliding Window Prep: Find max sum subarray of size k  

🧠 Review / Recall: Two pointers movement, in-place swapping, window start/end indices.

---

### Day 2: Sliding Window Deep Dive

1. Maximum Sum Subarray of size k  
2. Minimum Size Subarray Sum  
3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters  
4. Longest Substring with at Most K Distinct Characters  
5. Minimum Window Substring  
6. Permutation in String  
7. Fruit Into Baskets (longest substring with ≤2 distinct)  

🧠 Review / Recall: Dynamic window resizing, tracking with hashmap, when to move left pointer.

---

### Day 3: Prefix Sum & Hash Map

1. Running Sum of 1D Array  
2. Subarray Sum Equals K (find count)  
3. Product of Array Except Self  
4. Two Sum (unsorted)  
5. Contains Duplicate III (window + BST or buckets)  
6. Majority Element  
7. Number of Subarrays with Bounded Maximum  

🧠 Review / Recall: Prefix sums difference trick, hash‑based cumulative tracking.

---

### Day 4: Kadane’s and Extension Patterns

1. Maximum Subarray (Kadane)  
2. Best Time to Buy & Sell Stock I  
3. Maximum Product Subarray  
4. Best Time to Buy & Sell Stock II  
5. Maximum Sum Circular Subarray  
6. Maximum Subarray with One Deletion  
7. Max Value of Equation (monotonic deque variant)  

🧠 Review / Recall: Running sums, when to reset, prefix to suffix comparisons, handling negatives.

---

### Day 5: Binary Search on Arrays

1. Binary Search (classic)  
2. First and Last Position of Element  
3. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array  
4. Search in Rotated Sorted Array  
5. Median of Two Sorted Arrays (easy version)  
6. Find Peak Element  
7. Sqrt(x) (binary search)  

🧠 Review / Recall: Divide-and-conquer vs pointer strategies, locate boundaries, off‑by‑one edges.

---

### Day 6: Combined Patterns & Optimization

1. Sort Colors (Dutch National Flag)  
2. 3Sum (two pointers after sort)  
3. Subarray Sum Closest to Zero  
4. Container With Most Water (two pointers area)  
5. Trapping Rain Water (two pointers variant)  
6. Rotate Array (reverse segments)  
7. Merge Intervals  

🧠 Review / Recall: Combine sort + pointers, two-pointer maximization, overlapping intervals.

---

### Day 7: Matrix & 2D Array Patterns

1. Spiral Matrix  
2. Set Matrix Zeroes  
3. Rotate Image  
4. Matrix Diagonal Sum  
5. Lucky Number in Matrix  
6. Reshape the Matrix  
7. Flipping an Image  

🧠 Review / Recall: Row/column iteration, index mapping, in-place transformations.

---

## ✅ Daily Review Strategy

1. 15 min – Re-solve any tricky problem from previous day.  
2. 10 min – Summarize pattern logic in writing.  
3. 5 min – Code optimization review: time/space trade-offs, edge cases.

---

## 🧩 Advanced Tips from Top Coders

- Spell out invariants: “Window always contains at most k distinct”—makes debugging easier.  
- Dry-run examples with edge cases (e.g., empty input, all negatives, duplicates).  
- Guard boundaries: Use `while (left <= right)` vs `for (int r…)`.  
- One-pass over seeking optimization: Avoid nested loops unless format requires it.  
- See problem → identify pattern within 30 sec.  
- Pseudocode before code to clarify logic flow.  
- Comment key variables: e.g., `windowSum`, `startPointer`, `maxSoFar`.

## 🛡 After Week 1: Your Superpowers

- Knows when each pattern applies instantly  
- Solves common variants (sliding, fixed-size, rotating, searching)  
- Optimizes code (O(n) or O(n log n)), aces interview time pressures

---

### ⏭️ Next Level (after Week 1)

- Rotate between all patterns each day to solidify recall.  
- Gradually increase difficulty: Blind 75’s harder problems, Striver SDE sheet, longer drills.  
- Add graph & tree array overlays (prefix grids, matrix BFS, etc.).
