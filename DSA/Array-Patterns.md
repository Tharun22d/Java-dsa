| üîç Problem Type / Keywords                                             | üß© Pattern To Use                 | üõ†Ô∏è When to Use It                                                        |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "Max/Min sum of subarray", "fixed window size k"                       | Fixed Sliding Window              | When the window size is fixed (e.g., max sum of size `k`)                 |
| "Smallest/Largest window", "at most/exactly k", "substrings/subarrays" | Dynamic Sliding Window            | When the window size varies based on conditions                           |
| "Palindrome", "reversed array", "sorted input", "remove duplicates"    | Two Pointers                      | When you can operate from both ends or move slow/fast pointers            |
| "Find target sum", "count pairs", "complement", "frequency"            | Hash Map / Counting               | Use for quick lookups / frequency counts / prefix sums                    |
| "Sum of subarray", "range queries", "find total till index"            | Prefix Sum                        | Pre-calculate cumulative sums to answer range queries in O(1)             |
| "Max sum of contiguous subarray"                                       | Kadane‚Äôs Algorithm                | Use when you need to find max sum over any contiguous subarray            |
| "Search element", "sorted array", "rotated array", "first/last index"  | Binary Search                     | Array is sorted (fully or partially), search or optimize using mid-points |
| "Max area", "trapping water", "3Sum", "sorted + sum"                   | Two Pointers + Sorting            | Common for optimization with sorted input or symmetric traversal          |
| "Move elements", "rotate", "in-place changes", "rearrange"             | Reverse / In-place Swap           | Efficient memory use or rearranging arrays                                |
| "Prefix/suffix condition", "product except self"                       | Prefix + Suffix Arrays            | Useful when output depends on left + right traversal results              |
| "Sort colors", "partition 0/1/2", "Dutch flag"                         | Three Pointers / Partitioning     | Used to sort or group elements in-place in linear time                    |

## üß© Tips to Use This Cheatsheet

1. Start by scanning constraints:
   - Is the array sorted?
   - Are you allowed extra space?
   - Are you looking for a specific value, a count, or max/min?

2. Match problem structure to a pattern.

3. Use this as a decision tree:

```text
Is the array sorted?
  ‚îî‚îÄ Yes ‚Üí Try Two Pointers or Binary Search

Is it about subarrays / substrings?
  ‚îî‚îÄ Fixed size? ‚Üí Sliding Window (fixed)
  ‚îî‚îÄ Varying size with conditions? ‚Üí Sliding Window + HashMap

Need to find max sum / product?
  ‚îî‚îÄ Max contiguous sum? ‚Üí Kadane‚Äôs Algorithm
  ‚îî‚îÄ Product except self? ‚Üí Prefix & Suffix arrays

Asking for pair/triplet sum?
  ‚îî‚îÄ Sorted? ‚Üí Two Pointers
  ‚îî‚îÄ Unsorted? ‚Üí Hash Map

Is the problem index-based or range-based?
  ‚îî‚îÄ Use Prefix Sum
